# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteers to help expand this project.

Initially let's discuss this within the CG Slack **#arcs** channel

Here are some important resources:

  * [Diagrams in Documentation](https://medium.com/technical-writing-is-easy/diagrams-in-documentation-markdown-guide-4e78419e8d2f) which gives background on how to integrate *md* with different diagrams.
  * [Our roadmap](http://https://github.com/cglcgcg/arch_md/wish-list) as a potential landing page.

## Testing

No testing today.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to opengovernment](https://github.com/cglcgcg/arch_md/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  * This is innersource software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
  * Images will generated into an "/assets/" folder so if you have any manually generated images, perhaps they should go there as well?
